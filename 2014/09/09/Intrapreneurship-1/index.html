<p>There is a plethora of content along with courses on building new products especially for startups or small lifestyle businesses. But there is much less when it comes to introducing new offerings into an established business.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Further, most of the available information is about how to write a plan, whether it is a strategic, business, or marketing plan. While the process of writing these plans promotes thinking about risks, the risks associated with new business in an organization with successful products can be quite different from risks in other types of environments (e.g. a fledgling new startup). Thinking of risks in generalities and not having a detailed reference list more applicable to your situation means you will overlook some challenges others have frequently encountered in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>There is much more at stake for companies with already profitable lines of business when adding a new product. A wrong turn can take your portfolio from a market leader to a market follower. Beyond costing you opportunities that are available only to market leaders, such a move without adequate preparation can put the overall business at risk.</p>
<p>So, what are the questions to ask in order to identify the most common challenges when proposing or creating a new product in your company? Here is a list of my top 10:</p>
<p>1- Does the new product align with company goals and culture?</p>
<p>2- What are the required core competencies?</p>
<p>3- Have you done enough Market Research?</p>
<p>4- Have you identified Pilot Customers for the new product?</p>
<p>5- What’s your Brand Management Strategy?</p>
<p>6- Have you calculated the NPV (Net Present Value) &amp; identified Actionable Metrics?</p>
<p>7- Will the new product require a shift in culture / behavior / processes?</p>
<p>8- What will be the impact on existing customers, products, operations, etc.?</p>
<p>9- Partner, Build/integrate, Buy?</p>
<p>10- Do you have an Exit Strategy / Pivot Plan?</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, however, planning for how you will deal with these common pitfalls will take you a long way towards success. So, be sure to do your due diligence. Meanwhile, don’t try to complete to perfection every dimension of your plan prematurely. Just as complex systems evolve and self-organize, your product will also grow organically as long as you provide the right conditions. Remember, you can never guarantee the success of a new product. But you can minimize or eliminate wastes of your time, energy, and money on one where you have already identified significant road blocks. And while you might be in love with your new business idea and want to realize your vision as soon as possible, taking the time for careful planning will give you a much better vantage point. In fact, it might be the only thing that helps you easily navigate the treacherous waters of new product development at your company.</p>
<p>What are some challenges you have run into when pitching or executing a new business in your organization and how did you overcome those challenges?</p>
