    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thoughts on the question “Does the new product align with company goals and culture?” introduced in <a href="/2014/09/09/Intrapreneurship-1/">Part 1</a><br><a id="more"></a><br>While the goals of your company or business unit may not always be clearly communicated, do your best to evaluate whether the business you are proposing will agree with where the company wants to go. For example, if your company is looking for short-term revenue growth and you don’t expect your product to generate any revenue for the first five years, you might either pass on your idea or rework it for short-term revenue growth. Alternatively, if your company is a well-funded market leader and it is interested in products that will dominate markets rather than produce short-term revenue, other project proposals that are better aligned with the goal of the organization will have an advantage over yours.<br>Similarly, if the product you have in mind requires a completely different culture than the one established in your company, the gap may hinder your ability to execute.</p>
<p>In addition, even if your proposed business fits the company like a glove, you will still need to incentivize the organization to get support for your new project. Putting in place a proper compensation structure is certainly one of the most effective techniques. However, it is rarely an option. Still, while not spending too much time on this, propose a basic framework to incentivize anyone that will be involved.</p>

<p>This is Hazel, my daughter’s dog. This morning I took her to the beach and as she does every time, she started running with excitement.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, I love going to the beach -maybe because I grew up along the Mediterranean and I was almost addicted to the coast- but I don’t think I ever showed my happiness as much as Hazel does. She makes that happy puppy face, starts running in every direction sometimes sniffing with her nose in the sand and sometimes looking in the distance, alert as a coast guard. If there are birds around, then it’s definitely play time; by the way birds circle around and dive towards Hazel, it seems they enjoy play just as much.</p>

    <title>Setting up a Blogging Environment</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have made a commitment to start blogging more seriously and regularly. First, however, I wanted to research the best blogging tools and settle on one that would meet my main needs for some time to come. Some criteria that were on the top of my list were:<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Could I customize the UI and the background plumbing as needed? Granted, I didn’t want to build my own blogging tool from the ground up since there were already so many options, I still wanted to be able to tweak the theme I chose for the UI. I also wanted to extend the features using both the existing plugins and the new ones as they become available in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Could I get up and running quickly? Would I hit any road blocks later? The simpler the system, the quicker I could get up to speed and the fewer issues I would need to deal with later on as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Community</strong>: Was I getting on board with a tool that will be around for a while? For this, I reviewed several sites including  <a href="http://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">StaticGen</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it was not a clear-cut and easy decision, in the end, I chose to go with <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>. I will not go into further details on how I arrived at this conclusion because many of my considerations were very personal, such as choosing a tool based on Node.js versus one based on ruby because I already had a Node.js environment.</p>
<p>Once I settled on Hexo as the blogging framework, the next decision was where to host my blog. I had the option to push the content on to one of my servers or I could host it on GitHub Pages at a url such as <a href="ozbasarir.github.io">ozbasarir.github.io</a> for free with GitHub repository integration.</p>
<p>If I hosted on GitHub Pages, I could use the “hexo deploy” command (after installing the <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git" target="_blank" rel="external">git deploy plugin</a> with <code>npm install hexo-deployer-git --save</code> and updating  <code>_config.yml</code>) to push updates of my posts to a GitHub repo. And since GitHub Pages would automatically publish the content of this repo, the changes would be live on the public blog site at the same time without any additional effort. Because I was already comfortable with GitHub and had created a few repos previously, this option appealed to me and I went with hosting on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of my setup:</p>
<img src="/2016/09/13/Setting-up-a-Blogging-Environment/blogging_with_hexo_from_laptop.png" alt="Blogging with Hexo from laptop/desktop" title="Blogging with Hexo from laptop/desktop">
<p>As you can see in this diagram, I am using <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Atom</a> to edit the <code>source</code> files. These <code>source</code> files are created by Hexo as shown below:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">.</div><div class="line">├── source</div><div class="line">    ├── _drafts</div><div class="line">        ├── mypost1 (asset directory for mypost1)</div><div class="line">            ├── myimage1.jpg</div><div class="line">            └── ...</div><div class="line">        ├── mypost1.md</div><div class="line">        └── ... (an asset directory and a markdown file for each post)</div><div class="line">    ├── _posts</div><div class="line">        └── ... (same structure as _drafts, for published posts)</div><div class="line">    └── about (each custom page is a separate directory like this one)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Atom has a live preview pane that comes handy when editing the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="external">Markdown</a> (.md) files in the <code>source</code> directory.</p>
<p>Once a post is written, it is time to generate the <code>public</code> files that will be deployed to the server. These <code>public</code> files are the final static html pages and related assets of your blog.</p>
<p>To generate <code>public</code> from <code>source</code>, use the command:<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">hexo generate</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>To deploy <code>public</code>:<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">hexo deploy</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Finally, I could navigate to my blog at the GitHub Pages url and proofread. GitHub Pages also gives the option to use your own domain name via a CNAME record.</p>
<p>Well, now that I have my blogging environment up and running, I will need to find new excuses to distract myself from writing the next blog post. Wish me luck :)</p>

<p>There is a plethora of content along with courses on building new products especially for startups or small lifestyle businesses. But there is much less when it comes to introducing new offerings into an established business.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Further, most of the available information is about how to write a plan, whether it is a strategic, business, or marketing plan. While the process of writing these plans promotes thinking about risks, the risks associated with new business in an organization with successful products can be quite different from risks in other types of environments (e.g. a fledgling new startup). Thinking of risks in generalities and not having a detailed reference list more applicable to your situation means you will overlook some challenges others have frequently encountered in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>There is much more at stake for companies with already profitable lines of business when adding a new product. A wrong turn can take your portfolio from a market leader to a market follower. Beyond costing you opportunities that are available only to market leaders, such a move without adequate preparation can put the overall business at risk.</p>
<p>So, what are the questions to ask in order to identify the most common challenges when proposing or creating a new product in your company? Here is a list of my top 10:</p>
<p>1- Does the new product align with company goals and culture?</p>
<p>2- What are the required core competencies?</p>
<p>3- Have you done enough Market Research?</p>
<p>4- Have you identified Pilot Customers for the new product?</p>
<p>5- What’s your Brand Management Strategy?</p>
<p>6- Have you calculated the NPV (Net Present Value) &amp; identified Actionable Metrics?</p>
<p>7- Will the new product require a shift in culture / behavior / processes?</p>
<p>8- What will be the impact on existing customers, products, operations, etc.?</p>
<p>9- Partner, Build/integrate, Buy?</p>
<p>10- Do you have an Exit Strategy / Pivot Plan?</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, however, planning for how you will deal with these common pitfalls will take you a long way towards success. So, be sure to do your due diligence. Meanwhile, don’t try to complete to perfection every dimension of your plan prematurely. Just as complex systems evolve and self-organize, your product will also grow organically as long as you provide the right conditions. Remember, you can never guarantee the success of a new product. But you can minimize or eliminate wastes of your time, energy, and money on one where you have already identified significant road blocks. And while you might be in love with your new business idea and want to realize your vision as soon as possible, taking the time for careful planning will give you a much better vantage point. In fact, it might be the only thing that helps you easily navigate the treacherous waters of new product development at your company.</p>
<p>What are some challenges you have run into when pitching or executing a new business in your organization and how did you overcome those challenges?</p>
