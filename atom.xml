    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have made a commitment to start blogging more seriously and regularly. First, however, I wanted to research the best blogging tools and settle on one that would meet my main needs for some time to come. Some criteria that were on the top of my list were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Can I customize the UI as well as the background plumbing as needed? Granted, I didn’t want to build my own blogging tool from the ground up since there were already so many options, I still wanted to be able to tweak the theme I choose for the UI. I also wanted to extend features with both with existing plugins and new ones as they become available in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Can I get up and running quickly? Will I hit any road blocks later? The simpler the system, the quicker I can get up to speed and the fewer issues I will need to deal with later on as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Community</strong>: Am I getting on board with a tool that will be around for a while? For this, I reviewed several sites including  <a href="http://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">StaticGen</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it was not a clear-cut and easy decision, in the end, I chose to go with <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>. I will not go into further details on how I arrived at this conclusion because many of my considerations were very personal, such as choosing a tool based on Node.js versus one based on ruby since I already had a Node.js environment.</p>
<p>Once I settled on Hexo as the blogging framework, the next decision was where to host my blog. I had the option to push the content on to one of my servers or I could host it on GitHub Pages at a url such as <a href="ozbasarir.github.io">ozbasarir.github.io</a> for free with GitHub repository integration.</p>
<p>If I hosted on GitHub Pages, I could use the “hexo deploy” command (after installing the <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git" target="_blank" rel="external">git deploy plugin</a> with <code>npm install hexo-deployer-git --save</code> and updating  <code>_config.yml</code>) to push updates of my posts to a GitHub repo. And since GitHub Pages would automatically publish the content of this repo, the changes would be live on the public blog site at the same time without any additional effort. Because I was already comfortable with GitHub and had created a few repos previously, this option appealed to me and I went with hosting on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of my setup:</p>

<p>As you can see in this diagram, I am using <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Atom</a> to edit the <code>source</code> files. These <code>source</code> files are created by Hexo as shown below:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">.</div><div class="line">├── source</div><div class="line">    ├── _drafts</div><div class="line">        ├── mypost1 (asset directory for mypost1)</div><div class="line">            ├── myimage1.jpg</div><div class="line">            └── ...</div><div class="line">        ├── mypost1.md</div><div class="line">        └── ... (an asset directory and a markdown file for each post)</div><div class="line">    ├── _posts</div><div class="line">        └── ... (same structure as _drafts, for published posts)</div><div class="line">    └── about (each custom page is a separate directory like this one)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Atom has a live preview pane that comes handy when editing the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="external">Markdown</a> (.md) files in the <code>source</code> directory.</p>
<p>Once a post is written, it is time to generate the <code>public</code> files that will be deployed to the server. These <code>public</code> files are the final static html pages and related assets of your blog.</p>
<p>To generate <code>public</code> from <code>source</code>, use the command:<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">hexo generate</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>To deploy <code>public</code>:<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">hexo deploy</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Finally, I could navigate to my blog at the GitHub Pages url and proofread. GitHub Pages also gives the option to use your own domain name via a CNAME record.</p>
<p>Well, now that I have my blogging environment up and running, I will need to find new excuses to distract myself from writing the next blog post. Wish me luck :)</p>
